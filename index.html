									<h2><a href="#">Yet Another Olin Experiment</a></h2>
									<p>Olin College of Engineering is a school all about project based learning,<br />
                    which means that there's lots of experiments going on all the time.<br />
                    This is just one of those experiments!</p>
								</header>
								<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="{{ "/images/olin_over.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></a>
                <p>Due to Olin's function as a purely engineering college (though with a strong flavor of entrepreneurship),
                  there is no computer science major, and so the computing track is a bit limited and gets specialized quickly.</p>
                <p>All students are exposed to computing their first semster, and all will work with computing throughout their career at Olin.
									However, there's only one computing class after the one in the first semester that is generalized and applies to everyone, though it's not a required class.
								</p>
								<p>
									Despite this, it has been noticed that computing is becoming more and more common, and becoming more and more necessary. So, in conjuntion with the NSF and the REU Scripting for All (+ Disciplines), a couple of rising sophomores have looked into turning computing into more of a literacy at Olin. They've been looking into what computing class Olin needs that would apply to the most students, to better prepare students for life outside college.
